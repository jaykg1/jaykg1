### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jaykg1/jaykg1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- Name:Jacqueline Gitari
- Email: jgitari@my.waketech.edu
- This is my personal, and school Github account! I will use this account for projects that I plan to create for school and creative use.
- In order to clone my repository, I opened the Github Desktop app, and clicked on the "+" icon, and then the "Clone a Repository" button. After clicking the button, I was given a few ways to source my repository, and I clicked on "Clone from the internet", which allowed me to find the repository that I had just created, "jaykg1.github.io". Once I clicked on that, the app downloaded a copy of the repository on my computer.
